# cudaGL
Minimal/experimental and VERY slow CUDA-based 3d renderer supporting basic shader-ish operations.

This small experiment implements a vertex and fragment shader as part of a graphics "pipeline" written in Cuda C++. It is not yet optimized, and should not be used for any serious applications.
